Faux Hollows solver based on popular web tool [https://sturalke.github.io/FauxHollowsProbabilisticSolver/](https://sturalke.github.io/FauxHollowsProbabilisticSolver/) by Fyrin Niyuun @ Behemoth but with revised recommendation logic.
The aforementioned tool considers all conceivably possible board patterns however it has been observed that not all such patterns can be generated by the game. All reported patterns have been catalogued by u/Ylandah in [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mUyCzlzDmdXMwaSTUgWXtEA45oJNn-iB4_bVM43zf58/edit?usp=drivesdk](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT_86iXUmlPcdn6Eimh2QqSEe1mBy5PJCjutOaQPZJpPeiLnYkG1WVApuEgj-HhZzWuKHr4fKTBL1O2/pubhtml#) and will be assumed to be an exhaustive list.
The logic used in this tool is inspired by 3Blue1Brown video [https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA?si=XqW2KUYzIUFwCwD1](https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA?si=XqW2KUYzIUFwCwD1).
